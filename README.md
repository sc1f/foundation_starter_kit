*Foundation Starter Pack*
- `git clone` this repository, and copy the folders into your `resources` folder or wherever static files go
- works for Laravel and Django (tested)
- Includes a SASS copy of Foundation's CSS that is compiled along with your main user CSS file
- Future improvements: compile Foundation separately from the main CSS file to ensure efficiency
